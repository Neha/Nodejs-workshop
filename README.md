# :computer: Nodejs-workshop

Welcome to the Nodejs codelab. This codelab is divided into 5 parts. Starting from the :zero: understanding of nodejs to advance (using GraphQL). This is a well balanced codelab with theory and hands on.

## :white_check_mark: Session 1: Introduction to Nodejs [THEORY]

## :golf: Agenda

Target of this workshop to understand what is client-server relationship and where they fit into the web applications.After that we will understand what nodejs , why it is important , where to use it and how is using it. We will also learn about the building blocks of nodejs - _event-loop_ , _single-thread_, _non-blocking input output_, _V8_ and _call-stack_. We will touchbase - get(), post(), patch(), delete(), put() and timers too. We will learn about NPM and will setup nodejs, nodemon and create our first server and do the get request.

- Create your first request client-server

## :white_check_mark: Session 2: Express installation [THEORY + CODELAB]

## :golf: Agenda

Now, we know Nodejs and used the http modules. Now, we will use framework - Express. We will understand what express and why we should use it. We will also go through the project we will be creating for this workshop. We will refactor the folder and files as per the project.

- EJS introduction

### Project walkthrough

- Understand the project
- Refactor the folder
- Develop static HTML in EJS
- Develop the routes for same pages
- Do get() request for same
- Congratualtions you have a nodejs based application!!

## :white_check_mark: Session 3: API in nodejs

## :golf: Agenda

Now, we know Nodejs, Express and used the http modules. Now, we will use framework - Express to create APIs. We will create APIs in Express. We will also go through the project we will be creating for this workshop. We will refactor the folder and files as per the project.

### Introduction to APIs [THEORY]

- What is API
- Different type of APIs

### Create your own API [CODELAB]
