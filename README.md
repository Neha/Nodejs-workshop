# :computer: Nodejs-workshop

Welcome to the Nodejs codelab. This codelab is divided into 5 parts. Starting from the :zero: understanding of nodejs to advance (using GraphQL). This is a well balanced codelab between theory and handson.

## :white_check_mark: Session 0: Introduction to Nodejs [THEORY]

## :golf: Agenda

Target of this workshop to understand what servers & client-server relationship are and where they fit into the web developers web applications.After that we will understand what nodejs , why it is important , where to use it and how is using it. We will also learn about the building blocks of nodejs - _event-loop_ , _single-thread_, _non-blocking input output_, _V8_ and _call-stack_. We will touchbase - get(), post(), patch(), delete(), put() and timers too. We will learn about NPM and will setup nodejs, nodeman and create our first server and do the get request.
